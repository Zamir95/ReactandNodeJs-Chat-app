# ReactandNodeJs-Chat-app
# Note: this is a back-end and front-end based webchat app
NodeJs and React Chatapp. All files are provided with a few of the files not being able to upload since its too big. You need to install npm pkgs such bcrypt, splice, JWT, cookies, etc. Will soon be hosted on my website. For now enjoy. To start the client you need to use cd client then npm start and to start server you need to do cd server then nodemon index.
